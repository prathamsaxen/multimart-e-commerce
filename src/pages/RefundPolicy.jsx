            In any of the above cases, contact must be made within 48 hours of
            receipt of the products by email
            homegloster@gmail.com&nbsp;notifying us of any damage to the product
            with pics of the product received. We will schedule return pick up
            for the product. Upon return, the article will undergo a quality
            check to ensure the quality problem is found to be our
            responsibility rather than misuse or abuse of the product outside of
            our control. Once the returned product passes the quality check to
            ensure it is unused and in its original packaging stage, an
            exchange/refund will be processed.

            We ensure only the best quality reaches to our customers as each
            product goes through a well-defined quality check process. However,
            these being art products, please note that there may be slight
            variation in looks and finish. The colors shown on the website are
            close the real color of the product to the extent possible. However,
            depending upon your display screen, the colors may vary slightly. In
            case of handmade paintings, there may be minor variations due to
            nature of the work.
